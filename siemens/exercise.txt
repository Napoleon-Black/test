Welcome to our exercise on the analysis of CSV-like files!

Introduction:

 There are 1000 CSV-like files of the following format:
  The first line shows the character encoding of the file.
  The following lines contain the data in three columns:
  - entity name: one of a, b, c, d, e, f.
    It describes different entities within a file.
  - value: a float formatted value
  - string: a character sequence
  The columns are separated by ',' (byte 0x2c).

Tasks:

 1. One goal is to process all files and count the number of occurrences
    for each entity in the 1000 files.

 2. Then, how many different strings are found for each entity.

 3. Finally, a histogram shall visualize the frequency of the values of each entity.
    Therefore, the value of each entity shall be sorted into 20 intervals:
	
    interval 0: -infinite <  value < 1
    interval 1:         1 <= value < 2
    interval 2:         2 <= value < 3
    interval 3:         3 <= value < 4
    .
    .
    .
    interval 18:       18 <= value < 19
    interval 19:       19 <= value < infinite

    Count how many values are sorted into which interval for each entity.

 Q1: What kind of distributions can be found for the different entities?

 Q2: There is misformatted data in some of the 1000 files.
     How do you deal with them? What are the consequences for the analysis?

Have fun,
